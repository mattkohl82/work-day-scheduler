This is a work day planner. It has a working clock at the top that stays updated to the second. 
There are slots for all 24 hours in the day cause you never know what schedule a person leads. The hours
of the day will turn gray once passed, red when present, and green when upcoming. 

Data is saved to localStorage and should be present upon refresh.
